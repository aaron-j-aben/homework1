What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repo or code base that is hosted remotely on a server as opposed to a local device.
Based on my understanding, a remote repository is the center of the version control for a project. People working
on the project make modifications on their local copies of the remote repository and update the remote repository
when they make changes they want to commit.
