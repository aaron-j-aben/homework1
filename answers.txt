What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging involves combines the changes of one branch to another; any time a merge occurs, a commit representing 
the merge is added to the history of the repository. The merge commit has two "parent" commits, one each for the
states of the "source" branch and the "target" branch of the merge. What having these two commits does is maintain
the history of changes for the source and target branches and show where the two branches intersect.

Rebasing instead "rewrite history" in that the individual histories of both branches are not maintained, and it
appears to anyone looking at the repository after that all the commits made in the "source" branch all occurred
after the commits in the target branch that occurred before the rebasing. What this means is that rather than
the history reflecting the simultaneous changes occuring, rebasing makes it seem like the commmits occur
